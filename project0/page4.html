  <h1 id="newHeader"> Andrew's Time as the Worlds Tallest Man </h1>

    <p class="class2" >After his stint a a music superstar, Andrew took on a new challenge; becoming the world's tallest man
      Working hard at growing every day for 3 years, Andrew grew over 7 feet tall in that period. He gained the record
      in 2005, becoming the tallest person at 13 feet tall. He most guarantees it wasn't just 2 guys in a trenchcoat and that he definitely is that tall. </p>
